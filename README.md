# react-portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create my own personal portfolio page. As the only things I have created in my time programming are video games I have linked those in my website and set up a dummy resume as I wasnt given an example of how the resume should look however due to the header having one I thought I should include it just to be sure.

I was to ensure the links worked and that the html and css were properly commented along with the webpage sizing to different screens. I had a really fun time working on this project and I hope you enjoy it.
