## Usage Mobile

For the most part usage is similar as to the desktop version, here you see the main page on mobile with a bit of a large change, the nav bar has been removed and replaced with a menu button in the top left corner.

Clicking this nav bar opens up the menu and you see the nav bar vertically displayed along with some social media links, linkedin, as well as a link to my github.
