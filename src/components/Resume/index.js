      <h1>Skills And Abilities </h1>
      <br />
      <h1>COMMUNICATION </h1>
      <p>
        Going through school requires the skill of communication to present many
        projects and speeches in front of peers and strangers and working in
        food service requires a wide variety of conversational skills. From
        handling upset customers to dealing with stagnant co-workers I have been
        there and done that. 
      </p>
      <br />
      <h1>Hard Work</h1>
      <p>
        Hard work was taught to me since I was a 13-year-old boy by my oboe
        instructor, and continue to be a part of my character to this day. It
        has persisted with me to always do my best and keep pushing forward even
        when nobody is looking. Never cut corners and always give 100%.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h1>Leadership</h1>
      <p>
        I was in the band for all 4 years at Martin Luther King High School,
        with 2 of those years being in the leadership program, and my senior
        year being the leader of my section. In customer service I was the shift
        lead for a majority of my time and training new employees was a part of
        my job.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h1>Experience</h1>
      <br />
      <h1>OFFICE ASSISTANT | RIVERSIDE COUNTY PHILHARMONIC | 2018 - 2020 </h1>
      <p>
        I worked with the Riverside County Philharmonic for 2 years helping them
        with a various amount of their day to day needs as an organization.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        A majority of my time was dedicated to doing office work for the
        Executive Director at the time. I would proofread documents and print
        out fliers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long work hours are not a problem for me as many days I would be working
        for 10 or more hours at a time.{" "}
      </p>
      <br />
      <h1>FOOD INDUSTRY</h1>
      <p>I worked at Dickey’s Barbecue in the Riverside Plaza for 8 months.</p>
      <p>
        I was the front-man Block/shift lead who would take orders and prepare
        food. I would also ensure that everything was going smoothly in the
        restaurant while the manager was away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Training new employees and generally having knowledge of every job was
        necessary to keep the restaurant running at full capacity.{" "}
      </p>
      <br />
      <h1>PROGRAMMING </h1>
      <p>
        I have a few comfort projects which started me into programming. They
        use C# and unity to create fun mobile games which can be found on my
        itch.io page. https://weapontostopwar.itch.io/{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        I also have a lot of projects that I have made over the course of my
        bootcamp that can be found on my GitHub. https://github.com/wron1{" "}
