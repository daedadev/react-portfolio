    specifies in React and Javascript coding. I have studied Javascript\r\n          and CSS under the direction of Farish Kashefinejad while at the\r\n          University of Riverside Coding Bootcamp. I have a decent amount of\r\n          previous experience with coding through a couple years of using Unity\r\n          to develop video games for mobile devices. I also have experience\r\n          working with google chrome extensions and have made a few self\r\n          projects using electron.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          Since starting the coding bootcamp at UCR I have gained much knowledge\r\n          involving the use of MySQL, mongoDB, local web storage and utilizing\r\n          and creating API's. I have learned so much during the course of the\r\n          camp, team work and fast learning being amongst my most polished\r\n          skills. The larger sized units of the projects below are some\r\n          displaying that knowledge while the smaller works are some of my\r\n          personal accomplishments.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          After completing the bootcamp amongst the top of my class I have come\r\n          to know quickly that I have a lot to learn and am honing my skills day\r\n          After day. My team work skills, quick learning and highly flexible\r\n          personality make me an adaptable worker and an amazing asset to any\r\n          team.
